Synopsis

This is a single reactively sized, news page which draws real articles from New york Times' API. intended to display more advanced understanding of javascript and jquery, integrating ajax queries.

This is my second project in the webdev cohort for RED Academy, in Vancouver. We were given an image of a site at 3 different sizes to display reactive differences between mobile, tablet and desktop screen resolutions. We had a shorter deadline for this project, and it was interesting to see my knowledge of javascript evolve from seeing it as some kind of sorcery, to actually having a good base of knowledge, and not having to google every line of code.
